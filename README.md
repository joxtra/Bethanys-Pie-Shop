An online bakery is a virtual store on the Internet where customers can browse the catalog and select pies. User can select many pies and those will be stored in cart. At checkout time, the items in the shopping cart will be presented as an order. At that time, more information will be needed to complete the transaction. Usually, the customer will be asked to fill the basic details or select a billing address, a shipping address, a shipping option, and payment information such as credit card number or others.
